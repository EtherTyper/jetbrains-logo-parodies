# JetBrains Logo Parodies

I was having fun marking my initials on all of the JetBrains IDEs, just in case I had the opportunity to build any of them from source! I hope you like the results, especially R++, Kotlin, and MPS, which I designed specifically!

I acknowledge that my usage of the JetBrains logos does not constitute association or sponsorship with JetBrains, however cool that might be. Also, I claim fair use according to Section 107 of the Copyright Act for any unspoken copyrights attached to the original images, available at the [JetBrains Press Room](https://jetbrains.com/company/press/). These parody logos are just for fun, obeying the major laws stated in the original ```README.txt``` file, with  of the press materials!
